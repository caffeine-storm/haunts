tmckee: sometimes startup breaks:
	- the problem is that we can end up calling renderQueue.Purge from a job
	  running in the render queue; Purge won't return until the renderloop pumps
	  but the loop won't make progress until Purge returns.

- The main menu doesn't render the buttons we'd expect

- Trying to open the console only paints a pink layer on top of everything
	- Note that the 'error texture' from glop's sprite manager is a
	  semi-transparent pink rectangle.

- The 'game mode' screen doesn't render its text correctly

base.Log messages don't uniquely identify the file

Can get locked up by repeatedly opening/closing the same door.

Can have a door not connected to a room.
