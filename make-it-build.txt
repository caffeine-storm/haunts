... ummm licensing much?
	- e.g. github.com/MobRulesGames/xyz doesn't have license files => all rights
	  reserved must be assumed => can't use it! not even locally
		- but lots of github.com/runningwild/xyz _does_ have a license!
	- what does the GNU Affero let me do?
		- modify/copy/distribute with replication+honouring of original AGPL
			- a.k.a. copy left
	- need to start at the top and prune out what isn't open source
		- Need a tool to scrape imports inside haunts/ and find/fetch/verify
		  license files
			- go-licenses
	- is it legit to get non-open stuff building and use that as a local
	  comparison/sanity check?
		- NOPE! https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1720/what-can-i-assume-if-a-publicly-published-project-has-no-license


go-licenses doesn't detect the license in freetype; we can use either the
freetype license or GPLv2

repos that aren't licensed :(
	- mrg/cmwc nor rw/cmwc
		- it's a RNG; can probably use an alternative
	- janky for /fmod ; can re-write go-bindings over fmod c-code, though
  - fsnotify: get events when things happen in the filesystem
  - opengl: mayb go-gl-legacy? otherwise, more bindings on top of opengl (though, should note that gl21 seems to be the right version)
	- rw/glop is unknown according to go-licenses?
		- it's BSD-3-clause as of bcbcf49
	- rw/yedparse is unknown
		- some xml parsing for output from yFiles; deserializing graphs


WORK-IN-PROGRESS: see test/licences/check-licences.sh


NOTES:
- glop: ubuntu: need to install multi-lib support for C/C++
	- sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib

- gl:
	- make the type check in gl.go's "ptr" static; pls!

--------
- Make `go build ./...` work
	- glop's 'gui.MakeDictionary' has been removed
		- for text rendering
		- we can still load from files, there's some in data/fonts/*.gob

- Use glop to render some text
	- 'defer' seems to have been ... misused

- Do we need to worry about building in devel mode? build-tag: // +build !release

- golua doesn't link; confusion ensues

- can punt on sound with 'go build -o haunts -tags nosound --ldflags "-extldflags \"-L /path/to/libglop.so\"" main.go GEN_version'
