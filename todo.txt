- bug#6: The 'edit mode' screen can really lag out; afterwards, switching back to the startup screen seems to break
	- we need to profile and optimize it
	- blockage in drivers? __driDriverGetExtensions_d3d12 seems like the culprit
		; best guess is that it's building a string describing all the GL
		extensions that the wslg d3d12 'gallium' driver supports. Rebuilding every
		time most likely T_T
	- ... now's as good a time as any to port to windows... let's see if it's
	  Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux or Windows-Sans-Linux...

- bug#1: The 'edit mode' screen doesn't render its text correctly

- verify licenses
	- see test/licenses

- Do we need to worry about building in devel mode?
	- build-tag: // +build !release

- bug#3: Trying to open the console only paints a pink layer on top of everything
	- Note that the 'error texture' from glop's sprite manager is a
	  semi-transparent pink rectangle.
- bug#4: Can get locked up by repeatedly opening/closing the same door.
	- needs repro
- bug#5: Can have a door not connected to a room.
	- needs repro

- bug#8: <next>
