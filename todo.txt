- bug#15: glop has its own texture package/manager but there is another,
  similar-but-not-the-same, one in haunts. We should DRY it out.

- bug#14: naming in door.go seems weird. It might be that 'floor' things are
	_actually_ referring to drawing operations that will affect the look of the
	floor, but I kinda doubt it.

- bug#13: improve base.registry APIs;
	- lots of reflection was needed b/c of a lack of generics back in the day
	- there seems to be the start of a "use this initializer hook" with the
		"autoload" tag but there doesn't seem to be any real use of it? Perhaps
		redesign how/where/if a constructor runs when loading the object.

- bug#12: improve APIs so that we don't have to _remember_ to call SetupGLStuff
	everywhere.

- bug#10: tests that need to be skipped for now can be tagged with this bug.
	That way, we can easily find them and disable higher-level tests when we need
	to re-focus.

- bug#9: house/room.go is calling gl.DrawElements in room.Render but it doesn't
	look to be using the correct count of elements; it's counting vertices _and_
	vertices that aren't part of the ARRAY_BUFFER being rendered!!!

- console is getting input even when it's not open

- edit screen is showing a furniture editor by default
	- we should expect a list of furniture down the RHS
	- r.n., some furniture (or some other text-line, tbh) has a name 'data-runtime' which seems wrong? see house/furniture_tab.go:54

- bug#8: house.MakeLosTexture should either always get called on a render
	thread or never get called on a render thread. If we refactor game/los.go's
	alloc() to farm out the call to a render thread, we can remove the
	queue-from-within in house.MakeLosTexture, then always call the whole
	function on a render thread.

- room.far_left.wall_alpha == room.far_right.wall_alpha == 0 ... which will make rendering on the wall transparent T_T
	- not-test calls to room.Render do a _bunch_ of math to get the left, right and floor matrices
	- need proper encapsulation on gl ID holding structs
	- need to DRY out WallTexture.setupGlStuff; lot of duplication between floor, left-wall and right-wall

- bug#6: The 'edit mode' screen can really lag out; afterwards, switching back to the startup screen seems to break
	- we need to profile and optimize it
	- blockage in drivers? __driDriverGetExtensions_d3d12 seems like the culprit
		; best guess is that it's building a string describing all the GL
		extensions that the wslg d3d12 'gallium' driver supports. Rebuilding every
		time most likely T_T
	- note: running `glxgears` while running `haunts` can cause `glxgears` to
	  stop rendering properly once `haunts` hits the hitch
		- this could indicate that something in WSL is crashing (maybe XWayland?)

- bug#1: The 'edit mode' screen doesn't render its text correctly

- verify licenses
	- see test/licenses

- Do we need to worry about building in devel mode?
	- build-tag: // +build !release

- bug#3: The console doesn't look right

- bug#4: Can get locked up by repeatedly opening/closing the same door.
	- needs repro
- bug#5: Can have a door not connected to a room.
	- needs repro

- bug#16: <next>
