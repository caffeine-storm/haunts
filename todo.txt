- Do we need to worry about building in devel mode?
	- build-tag: // +build !release

bugs:
- The 'edit mode' screen doesn't render its text correctly
- Running 'make test' complains that ld failed to find -lglop but the tests
  still pass!
	- presumably, this is a report from the go-build cache'd version?
- glop logging has a 'source' attribute that is way too long
- Trying to open the console only paints a pink layer on top of everything
	- Note that the 'error texture' from glop's sprite manager is a
	  semi-transparent pink rectangle.
- base.Log messages don't uniquely identify the file
- Can get locked up by repeatedly opening/closing the same door.
	- needs repro
- Can have a door not connected to a room.
